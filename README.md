Apex Task 1 – My Simple Web

This repository contains my first assignment for Apex Planet Private Limited: a clean, responsive personal web portfolio built with basic HTML and CSS. The site includes an about section, project gallery, and contact information—providing a straightforward demonstration of web design fundamentals.

Features:

Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

Modern, clean user interface

Sections for profile, skills, and projects

Simple, standards-compliant HTML and CSS structure

This project highlights foundational frontend development practices and serves as a starting point for more advanced web assignments. Deployed via GitHub Pages.
